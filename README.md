GAI-DEFENSE: A Generative AI-Powered Web Framework for Phishing Attack Detection and Data Analysis
Abstract
Cybersecurity threats, particularly phishing attacks, pose significant risks to online users and organizations. The increasing sophistication of phishing techniques necessitates the development of robust detection mechanisms that can analyze patterns and anomalies in phishing datasets. This research presents GAI-DEFENSE, a Generative AI-powered web framework designed to detect phishing attacks and analyze phishing datasets using advanced large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional machine learning-based phishing detection approaches that require extensive feature engineering and numerical model training, GAI-DEFENSE leverages LLMs to process phishing data in a structured text format, enabling more context-aware and dynamic phishing detection.

The web-based interface provides an interactive environment where users can upload phishing datasets, perform data analysis, and detect phishing attacks using LLM-based insights. The framework consists of two core functionalities: Data Analysis and Phishing Attack Detection. The Data Analysis module allows users to query the dataset using LLM-driven responses, enabling exploratory analysis without complex SQL or statistical methods. The Phishing Attack Detection module accepts real-time user inputs for URL attributes (e.g., domain length, URL structure) and formulates text-based representations to make LLM-based phishing predictions. The system ensures adaptability to diverse phishing datasets by dynamically transforming structured numerical data into textual descriptions, making it highly compatible with pre-trained generative AI models.

The framework is implemented using Flask for backend processing and JavaScript (jQuery) for frontend interactivity. It supports multi-model integration with LLMs such as ALBERT, DistilBERT, MobileBERT, TinyBERT, and ELECTRA, allowing users to compare phishing detection capabilities across different generative models. Additionally, the platform provides visualization tools for phishing indicators, offering an intuitive representation of the dataset's key attributes.

The research contributes to the field of cybersecurity by demonstrating that LLMs can effectively analyze structured phishing datasets and improve phishing detection accuracy through contextual understanding. By eliminating the dependency on traditional ML models, GAI-DEFENSE offers a scalable, adaptable, and AI-driven solution for phishing attack detection in real-time cybersecurity applications. Future work will explore fine-tuning LLMs on phishing-specific datasets to enhance detection performance further.
